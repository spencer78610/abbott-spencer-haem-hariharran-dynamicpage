# abbott-spencer-haem-hariharran-dynamicpage

This html page displays our team members from Dr.Nut and a little bit about them, and what they do here at Dr.Nut. We display this through a foundation of html code stylized with css propertys, and the functinallity of the willl be done with Javascript. Using Java will create a seperate section that only displays itself when this specific team memeber is "clicked" on. Giving the user a bunch of information about the team member they clicked on.
